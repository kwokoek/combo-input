combo-input
============

A combination polymer custom element that wraps built in polymer input types.

See polymer for more info at [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

## Build it

Make a root development folder, and clone this repository in it.

Now cd into the combo-input folder to build!

```
cd combo-input
bower install
```

Now we need to start a web server to serve up our demo page, which we need to run from one level up.

```
cd ..
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now point your browser at our demo page
```http://localhost:8000/combo-input/demo.html```
